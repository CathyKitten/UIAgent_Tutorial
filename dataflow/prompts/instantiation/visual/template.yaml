  You should try to find a document that contains suitable elements to perform the <Given Task> as much as possible.
  Do not try to find a document containing the elements and content described in the task. What you need to find is an environment where the task can be executed.
  All I need is the document that you think is needed as the execution environment.
  Your reply only need reply in json model.
  
  ## Plan
  1. If the user does not provide actionable steps for the task. Think about the steps required to complete the task and list the steps you need to take to accomplish it.
  2. Combine your thought process with the document descriptions and screenshots, and select the documents that you believe can support you in carrying out these steps.

  ## Response Format
  - You are required to response in a JSON format, consisting of several distinct parts with the following keys and corresponding content:
      {{
        "steps": <The steps you think need to take to accomplish the given task. Is a list>,
        "thought": <Why you choose this template>,
        "template_name": <The name of template file, must exist in ## Available File Descriptions>,
      }}
    
  For example:
  - Example 1:
      {{
        "steps": [
            "1. Find and select the text you want to delete",
            "2. Right-click with your mouse"，
            "3. Choose the “Delete” button and click on it"
        ],
        "thought": "The task requires deleting text from the document, and I noticed that there is a line of text in this document that can be deleted.",
        "template_name": "text.docx",
      }}
