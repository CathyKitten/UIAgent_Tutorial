  Response:
    observation: |-
      I observe the screenshot is a Word document containing a paragraph, which has a text element 'text to edit'. The given task has two options: one is add, and the other is delete.
    thought: |-
      My task is to detail the given task and give the step-by-step actions to take. 
      The user needs to add or delete text in the Word document. 
      According to the previous requirements, when multiple options exist, I must explicitly choose one. Therefore, I must make a choice between add and delete.
      Based on the screenshot, there is a text element 'text to edit'. I choose it as target object. Then choose to delete it.
      And based on the available apis and controls,the user can use "select_text" to select the target to delete,and "type_keys" to type in delete.
      Therefore,the user can detail the task to delete 'text to edit' in the Word document.
      In this case, the user should select the text to edit in the Word document and press the 'Delete' key on the keyboard to delete the selected text.
    new_task: |-
      Delete the 'text to edit' in the Word document.
    action_plans: |-
      {{"step 1":"choose the target text 'text to edit'","controlLabel": "", "controlText": "", "function": "select_text", "args": {{"text": "text to edit"}}}}
      {{"step 2":"type in delete keys to finish delete","controlLabel": "101", "controlText": "Edit", "function": "type_keys", "args": {{"text": "{DELETE}"}}}}

      <Given Task:> Highlight Text in document.
  Response:
    observation: |-
      I observe the screenshot is a Word document with a body containing a paragraph, which has a text element 'text to edit'.
    thought: |-
      My task is to detail the given task and give the step-by-step actions to take. 
      The user needs to highlight text in the Word document. 
      Based on the screenshot, there is a text element 'text to edit'.
      And based on the available apis and controls,the user can use "select_text" to select the target to highlight and then to highlight the text.
      Since there is no "Highlight" button available,I should click to the 'Home' tab first and then click the 'Highlight' button.
      Therefore,the user can detail the task to highlight 'text to edit' in the Word document.
      In this case, the user should select the 'text to edit' in the Word document and press the 'Home' button and 'Highlight' button respectively.
    new_task: |-
      Highlight 'text to edit' in the Word document.
    action_plans: |-
      {{"step 1":"choose the target text 'text to edit'","controlLabel": "", "controlText": "", "function": "select_text", "args": {{"text": "text to edit"}}}}
      {{"step 2":"change ribbon to Home to show the highlight button","controlLabel": "11", "controlText": "Home", "function": "click_input", "args": {{"button": "left", "double": false}}}}
      {{"step 3":"click the highlight button to finish highlight","controlLabel": "", "controlText": "Highlight", "function": "click_input", "args": {{"button": "left", "double": false}}}}

example3:
  Request: |-
      <Given Task:> Add a word in document.
  Response:
    observation: |-
      I observe the screenshot is a Word document containing a paragraph, which has a text element 'text to edit'.
    thought: |-
      My task is to detail the given task and provide step-by-step actions to take.
      The target location should be a logical place where text is added. Based on the document screenshot, I will add a word after the existing phrase 'text to edit'.
      Considering the available APIs and controls, the user can use "select_text" to move the cursor to the target position and "type_keys" to input the new word.
      Therefore, the detailed task is to add a word after 'text to edit' in the Word document.
      However, the task lacks a specific value, do not specify what word should be added. I need to assume a concrete word, like 'example'.
      Finally, the detailed task is to add the word 'example' after 'text to edit' in the Word document.
    new_task: |-
      Add the word 'example' after 'text to edit' in the Word document.
    action_plans: |-
      {{"step 1":"select the target text 'text to edit'","controlLabel": "", "controlText": "", "function": "select_text", "args": {{"text": "text to edit"}}}}
      {{"step 2":"move the cursor to the end of 'text to edit'","controlLabel": "101", "controlText": "Edit", "function": "move_cursor", "args": {{"position": "end"}}}}
      {{"step 3":"type in the word 'example'","controlLabel": "101", "controlText": "Edit", "function": "type_keys", "args": {{"text": " example"}}}}
