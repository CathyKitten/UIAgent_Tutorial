                task_overview=f'''## Task Overview
You are an evaluation system. You are given a request about an excel task along with the corresponding instructional video.
Your task is to rate each of the six criteria on a scale from 1 to 5 and provide a clear reason for each rating, following the definitions and scoring guidelines below:

<1> Clarity
Each instructional video step is clearly and explicitly described, with no ambiguity.
Scoring Guide:
1: Every step in the instructional video is unclear, making the tutorial completely incomprehensible.
2: Only a few steps are clear, making it difficult to understand the tutorial as a whole.
3: Only about half of the step descriptions are clear, which hinders understanding of the entire process.
4: Only a few steps are slightly unclear, but they do not affect the overall comprehension of the process.
5: Every step in the instructional video is very clearly described and completely unambiguous.

<2> Conciseness
There are no repeated or unnecessary steps in the instructional video.
Scoring Guide:
1: Almost all steps in the video are irrelevant or repetitive, making it hard for viewers to focus on the task.
2: More than half of the steps are redundant or clearly irrelevant, significantly reducing the efficiency of information delivery.
3: The video contains multiple redundant or unnecessary steps that may affect the viewing experience.
4: The video is generally concise, with only a few steps that do not hinder understanding.
5: There are no redundant, repetitive, or unnecessary steps at all.

<3> Correctness
There are no incorrect steps in the instructional video. An incorrect step is one that is necessary for completing the task but is performed incompletely or incorrectly. For example: (1) selecting only part of column A when the whole column should be selected; (2) The task requires entering a formula, but the step includes an incorrect formula.
Scoring Guide:
1: Most of the necessary steps in the video are incorrect, making it impossible to complete the task.
2: Several necessary steps in the video are incorrect, significantly hindering task completion.
3: Some necessary steps in the video are incorrect, affecting the ability to complete the task.
4: The video is mostly correct, with only a few errors in necessary steps that do not affect overall task completion.
5: All necessary steps are entirely correct, with no errors or inaccuracies.

<4> Completeness
The instructional video steps are complete, with nothing missing or skipped.
Scording Guide:
1: The video covers almost none of the essential operations, with major steps missing.
2: The video is missing many steps, with most key operations not shown.
3: About half of the steps are missing; the viewer cannot understand the overall task.
4: The video is mostly complete, with a few minor missing steps that do not significantly affect task completion.
5: No steps are missing; all necessary actions to complete the task are covered.

<5> Sequential Order
The steps in the instructional video are presented in a clear and logical sequence, without any disordered or confusing arrangements.
Scoring Guide:
1: The steps are completely out of order, making it impossible to understand the workflow.
2: Several key steps are in the wrong order, resulting in a confusing flow.
3: Some steps are misordered, which creates moderate difficulty in understanding the process.
4: Steps are mostly in a reasonable order, with only minor deviations that donâ€™t hinder understanding.
5: All steps are presented in a logical and coherent sequence.

<6> Text-Image Mapping
The text and images are well-aligned, with each image accurately matching its corresponding textual description.
Scoring Guide:
1: The text and images are almost entirely misaligned, causing severe comprehension issues.
2: More than half of the images do not match the text, significantly hindering understanding.
3: Several mismatches exist, making it difficult to follow some steps by correlating text and images.
4: Overall alignment is good, with only minor mismatches that do not affect comprehension.
5: All text and images are perfectly aligned, creating a smooth and coherent visual-textual experience.

5: Extremely efficient; compared to any other method, this tutorial saved me a massive amount of time and effort.

<3> Complete task
I was able to complete the tasks without problems.
Scoring Guide:
1: I was completely unable to complete the task based on the tutorial and was even led to an incorrect result.
2: I struggled significantly while completing the task, or I could only complete some of a part of the steps.
3: I eventually completed the task, but I encountered several problems or errors along the way that I had to solve myself.
4: I completed the task smoothly, encountering only one or two minor hiccups that were easily resolved.
5: I completed all task steps flawlessly and without any obstacles.

<4> Satisfaction
I was satisfied with tutorials like this.
Scoring Guide:
1: I am very dissatisfied with this experience; the entire process was frustrating and unhelpful.

4: I am satisfied with this experience; it was a positive and helpful process.
5: I am very satisfied with this experience; the process was pleasant, efficient, and far exceeded my expectations.

<5> Preference
When finding help online, I would prefer to use tutorials like this.
Scoring Guide:
1: I will actively avoid this type of tutorial in the future.
2: I would prefer to use other forms of tutorials (e.g., text-only documents, traditional videos).
3: I have no particular preference; I would use it if I come across it but would not actively seek it out.
4: In most situations, I would choose this type of tutorial first.
5: This is my most preferred format for tutorials; I will look for this type first when seeking help in the future.
