  ## Task Overview
  You are an Excel expert. You are given a user request, along with operation logs and screenshots from an agent performing Excel actions via a GUI.
  We need your help to turn this log into an instructional document. Your specific tasks are as follows:
  1. Generate an task title for the document and output to the "task_title" field. 
  2. Select the valid and correct steps, ignoring any duplicate or incorrect actions. Then summarize a title for each selected step in the log and generate a written explanation of this step to be included in the instructional document.
  The answer should be a dictionary and output to the "steps" field. 
  The format of the dictionary is as follows, "selected_step_number" can be obtained from the "Step" field in the Execution Trajectory:
  {{
  "selected_step_number":{{"title":...,"written_explanation":...}},
  "selected_step_number":{{"title":...,"written_explanation":...}},
  ...
  }}
  
 
  ## Understanding the Inputs

  ### Log Details
  Each step includes a structured execution log and a screenshot. The log contains:
  - **Thought**: The agent's reasoning at that step.
  - **ControlLabel / ControlText**: UI control identifiers and labels interacted with.
  - **Status**: Indicates the step status — e.g., `CONTINUE` (task ongoing), `FINISH` (task completed).
  - **Subtask**: The name of the subtask being handled.
  - **Action**: The function executed and parameters used, showing how the agent interacted with the UI.
  - **Request**: The goal or instruction issued to the agent.
  - **Error**: Any errors encountered during execution.

  ### Screenshot Details
  A screenshot is included after each step’s log, showing the current state of the Excel interface after that action.

  ## Output Format
  Your response must be a dictionary in this format:
  {{
  "task_title":...,
  "steps":{{
  "selected_step_number":{{"title":...,"written_explanation":...}},
  "selected_step_number":{{"title":...,"written_explanation":...}},
  ...
  }}
  }}
  - Replace selected_step_number with the actual numbers of the steps.
  - Your final output must **only** include the dictionary — do not add any other text or explanations.
  
  ## Tips
  - Ensure each written explanation is clear, concise, and instructive.
  - You may refer to the available API list below to better understand the agent’s interaction with Excel:
