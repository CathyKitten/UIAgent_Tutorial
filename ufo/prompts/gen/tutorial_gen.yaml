  ## Introduce
  
  Generate a user-friendly and easy-to-understand operation manual in Markdown format based on agent-executed Excel operation logs and screenshots. The manual should guide users step by step through completing the task, incorporating relevant images. Assume all images are located in the current directory.

  ## Requirements
  
  - Include a title summarizing the operation.
  - Provide clear, concise steps to complete the task.
  - Use Markdown formatting for structured readability.
  - Integrate screenshots at relevant points to visually support instructions.
  - Ensure the manual is user-friendly and easy to follow.
  
  The output should follow this structure:
  ```markdown
  # [Operation Title]
  
  [Introduction or brief description of the operation.]
  
  ## [Step 1 Title]
  [Detailed instruction for step 1.]
  
  ![Screenshot for step1](./screenshot1.png)
  
  ## [Step 2 Title]
  [Detailed instruction for step 2.]
  
  ![Screenshot for step2](./screenshot2.png)
  
  ...
  
  ```
  - Replace [Operation Title] with a concise title summarizing the task.
  - Replace [Introduction or brief description of the operation.] with a short description of the operation.
  - Replace [Step 1 Title], [Step 2 Title], etc., with appropriate step titles.
  - Replace [Detailed instruction for step 1.], [Detailed instruction for step 2.], etc., with clear and precise instructions.
  - Ensure that all provided screenshots are included in sequential order.
  - Use a professional and instructional tone.
  - Directly output the expected Markdown-formatted document without any extra content.
