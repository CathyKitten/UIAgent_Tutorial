  ## Task Overview
  You are an Excel expert. Given a user request, along with operation logs and screenshots from an agent performing Excel actions via a GUI.
  Your task is :
  1. Identify the valid and correct steps. Ignore any incorrect, redundant, or ineffective actions.
  2. Generate a step-by-step instruction dictionary for the user based on the selected correct steps.

  Your final output should be a dictionary:
  - The **key** is the step numbers (as an integer) of valid and correct stepss in logs. Note: convert the integers to strings to use as keys.
  - The **value** is a brief, clear description of the operation performed in that step.
  - The steps in the dictionary, when combined, should form a user-friendly and easy-to-understand operation manual that guides the user through the task.

  ## Understanding the Inputs

  ### Log Details
  Each step includes a structured execution log and a screenshot. The log contains:
  - **Thought**: The agent's reasoning at that step.
  - **ControlLabel / ControlText**: UI control identifiers and labels interacted with.
  - **Status**: Indicates the step status — e.g., `CONTINUE` (task ongoing), `FINISH` (task completed).
  - **Subtask**: The name of the subtask being handled.
  - **Action**: The function executed and parameters used, showing how the agent interacted with the UI.
  - **Request**: The goal or instruction issued to the agent.
  - **Error**: Any errors encountered during execution.

  ### Screenshot Details
  A screenshot is included after each step’s log, showing the current state of the Excel interface after that action.

  ## Output Format
  Your response must be a dictionary in this format:
  {{
    "step_number1": "Step description for step_number1",
    "step_number2": "Step description for step_number2",
    ...
  }}
  - Replace step_number1, step_number2, etc. with the actual numbers of valid and correct steps.
  - step_number refers to the number of the step selected from the log. Only the numbers of valid steps are needed, and they do not have to be consecutive.
  - Replace "Step description..." with a concise, user-oriented explanation of what was done.
  - The dictionary should not be enclosed in any markdown code block (e.g., no triple backticks or `json` markers).
  - Your final output must **only** include the dictionary — do not add any other text or explanations.
  
  ## Tips
  - Ensure each step description is clear, concise, and instructive.
  - You may refer to the available API list below to better understand the agent’s interaction with Excel:
